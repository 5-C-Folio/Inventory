/rule creation format is inconsistant.  While there should be a general principle to not repeat identical rules, sometimes for the purpose of readability, rules are broken apart- ie equipment, where there are an ever increasing number of rules.  Each rule is individual listed for readibility.  Audio and video games is not, because there are fewer rules
/The general principle is to name rules based off the loan type they are intended to apply to, rather than the loan policy.  The intent is to provide clarity for users assigning loan policies.  The correct loan policy for an item should be clear.
